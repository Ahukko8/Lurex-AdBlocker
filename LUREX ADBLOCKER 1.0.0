How to Install the Lurex AdBlocker from GitHub
This guide will walk you through installing the Lurex AdBlocker extension from GitHub to your Chrome browser. No coding experience is needed!
Prerequisites

Google Chrome browser installed
Basic knowledge of using a web browser
Internet connection

Step 1: Download the Extension from GitHub

Go to the Lurex AdBlocker GitHub repository https://github.com/Ahukko8/Lurex-AdBlocker.
Click the green "Code" button near the top right of the page.
Select "Download ZIP" from the dropdown menu.
Once downloaded, locate the ZIP file in your downloads folder.
Right-click the ZIP file and select "Extract All..." (Windows) or double-click it (Mac).
Choose where to extract the files and click "Extract".

Step 2: Prepare Chrome for Developer Mode Extensions

Open Google Chrome.
Type chrome://extensions/ in the address bar and press Enter.
Look for the "Developer mode" toggle in the top-right corner.
Toggle it to the ON position. This allows you to install unpacked extensions.

Step 3: Load the Extension

On the Chrome extensions page, click the "Load unpacked" button that appears after enabling Developer mode.
Navigate to the folder where you extracted the extension files.
Select the main folder (it should contain the manifest.json file) and click "Select Folder" (Windows) or "Open" (Mac).
The Lurex AdBlocker should now appear in your list of extensions with its icon.

Step 4: Verify Installation

Look for the Lurex AdBlocker icon in the Chrome toolbar (top-right area of your browser).

If you don't see it, click the puzzle piece icon to see all extensions, then pin Lurex AdBlocker.


Click the extension icon to open its popup interface.
Verify that all toggles are active (blue) and that the extension says "Active" at the top.

Step 5: Test the AdBlocker

Visit a website known for having ads (like news sites or blogs).
The counter in the extension popup should start showing blocked ads.
To test popup blocking, visit a site known for popups (streaming sites often have these).
The extension should prevent unwanted popups from opening.

Extension Features

Element Blocking: Hides ad elements on web pages
Advanced Protection: Blocks trackers and scripts
Popup Blocking: Auto-closes ad popup windows
Site Whitelisting: Easily disable the adblocker for specific sites
Filter Updates: Keep your filter lists current with a single click

Troubleshooting
Extension Not Blocking Ads?

Ensure the extension is enabled (click the icon and check if the main toggle is ON).
Make sure "Element Blocking" is toggled ON in the settings.
Try clicking "Update Now" at the bottom of the popup to update filter lists.
Refresh the page you're viewing.

Popups Still Appearing?

Check if "Popup Blocking" is enabled in the extension settings.
Some legitimate popups (ones you intentionally trigger) will still open.
Restart Chrome completely and try again.

Extension Icon Not Appearing?

Go to chrome://extensions/ again.
Find Lurex AdBlocker in the list and ensure it's enabled.
Click the puzzle piece icon in Chrome's toolbar and pin the extension.

Chrome Warning About Developer Mode
Chrome may occasionally show a warning about running extensions in Developer mode. This is normal for extensions not installed from the Chrome Web Store. Simply click "Continue" or dismiss the warning.
Keeping the Extension Updated
Since you've installed from GitHub, Chrome won't automatically update the extension. To get updates:

Return to the GitHub repository periodically.
Download the latest version.
Remove the old version from Chrome (right-click the extension icon and select "Remove from Chrome").
Install the new version following Steps 2-3 above.


That's it! You now have Lurex AdBlocker running on your Chrome browser. Enjoy a cleaner, faster, and more private browsing experience!
